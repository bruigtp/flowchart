# Overview 

`flowchart` is a package for drawing participant flow diagrams directly from a `data.frame` using tidyverse. It provides a set of functions that can be combined with `|>` to create all kinds of `flowchart`s from a `data.frame` in an easy way:

- `as_fc()` transforms a `data.frame` into a `fc` object that can be manipulated by the package

- `fc_split()` splits a `flowchart` according to the different values of a column in the `data.frame`

- `fc_filter()` creates a filtered box from the `flowchart`, based on the evaluation of an expression in the `data.frame`

- `fc_merge()` combines horizontally two different `flowchart`s

- `fc_stack()` combines vertically two different `flowchart`s

- `fc_modify()` allows to modify the parameters of the `flowchart` which are stored in `.$fc`

- `fc_draw()` draws the `flowchart` created by the previous functions

- `fc_export()` allows to export the `flowchart` drawn to the desired format

# Installation

We can install the stable version in CRAN:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("flowchart")
```

Or the development version from GitHub:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github('bruigtp/flowchart')
```

# `safo` dataset

We will use the built-in dataset `safo`, which is a randomly generated dataset from the SAFO trial[^1]. SAFO is an open-label, multicentre, phase III–IV superiority randomised clinical trial designed to assess whether cloxacillin plus fosfomycin administered during the first 7 days of therapy achieves better treatment outcomes than cloxacillin alone in hospitalised patients with meticillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia.

# Basic operations

The first step is to initialise the `flowchart` with `as_fc`. The last step, if we want to visualise the created `flowchart`, is to draw the `flowchart` with `fc_draw`. In between we can combine the functions `fc_split`., `fc_filter`, `fc_merge`, `fc_stack` with the operator pipe (`|>` or `%>$`) to create complex `flowchart` structures.

## Initialize

To initialize a `flowchart` from a dataset we have to use the `as_fc()` function:

```{r}
safo_fc <- safo |> 
  as_fc()

str(safo_fc, max.level = 1)
```

The `safo_fc` object created is a `fc` object, which consists of a list containing the tibble of the `data.frame` associated with the `flowchart` and the tibble that stores the `flowchart` parameters. In this example, `safo_fc$data` corresponds to the `safo` dataset while `safo_fc$fc` contains the parameters of the initial `flowchart`:

```{r}
safo_fc$fc
```

Alternatively, if a `data.frame` is not available, we can initialize a `flowchart` using the `N =` argument manually specifying the number of rows:

```{r include=FALSE}
as_fc(N = 230)
```

## Draw

The function `fc_draw()` allows to draw the `flowchart` associated to any `fc` object. Following the last example, we can draw the initial `flowchart` that has been previously created:

```{r}
safo_fc |> 
  fc_draw()
```

## Filter 

We can filter the `flowchart` using `fc_filter()` specifying the logic in which the filter is to be applied. For example, we can show the number of patients that were randomized in the study:

```{r fig.width = 6, fig.height = 5}
safo |> 
  as_fc(label = "Patients assessed for eligibility") |> 
  fc_filter(!is.na(group), label = "Randomized", show_exc = TRUE) |> 
  fc_draw()
```

Percentages are calculated from the box in the previous level. See 'Modify function arguments' for more information on the `label=` and `show_exc=` arguments. 

Alternatively, if the column to filter is not available, we can use the `N =` argument to manually specify the number of rows of the resulting filter:

```{r fig.width = 6, fig.height = 5}
safo |> 
  as_fc(label = "Patients assessed for eligibility") |> 
  fc_filter(N = 215, label = "Randomized", show_exc = TRUE) |> 
  fc_draw()
```

## Split

We can split the `flowchart` into groups using `fc_split()` specifying the grouping variable. The function will split the `flowchart` into as many categories as the specified variable has. For example, we can split the previous `flowchart` showing the patients allocated in the two study treatments:

```{r fig.width = 6, fig.height = 5}
safo |>
  dplyr::filter(!is.na(group)) |>
  as_fc(label = "Randomized patients") |>
  fc_split(group) |>
  fc_draw()
```

Percentages are calculated from the box in the previous level. 

Alternatively, if the column to split is not available, we can use the `N =` argument to manually specify the number of rows in each group of the resulting split:

```{r fig.width = 6, fig.height = 5}
safo |>
  dplyr::filter(!is.na(group)) |>
  as_fc(label = "Randomized patients") |>
  fc_split(N = c(105, 110), label = c("cloxacillin plus fosfomycin", "cloxacillin alone")) |> 
  fc_draw()
```

The idea is to combine the `fc_filter()` and `fc_split()` functions in the way we want to create different `flowchart` structures, however complex the may be. In some cases, we may want to create two different `flowcharts` then [merge or stack](combine-flowcharts.html) them into the same image.

## Export

Once the `flowchart` has been drawn we can export it to the most popular image formats, including both bitmap (png, jpeg, tiff, bmp) and vector (svg, pdf) formats, using `fc_export()`:

```{r eval = FALSE}
safo |> 
  as_fc(label = "Patients assessed for eligibility") |>
  fc_filter(!is.na(group), label = "Randomized", show_exc = TRUE) |> 
  fc_draw() |> 
  fc_export("flowchart.png")
```

We can change the size and resolution of the stored image.

```{r eval = FALSE}
safo |> 
  as_fc(label = "Patients assessed for eligibility") |>
  fc_filter(!is.na(group), label = "Randomized", show_exc = TRUE) |> 
  fc_draw() |> 
  fc_export("flowchart.png", width = 3000, height = 4000, res = 700)
```

# Additional Details

This vignette only covers the basic functionality of `flowchart`. Users may also be interested in more advanced functionality covered in the available articles, such as how to [customize a `flowchart`](flowchart-customization.html), or examples in the [Example Gallery](example-gallery.html).
